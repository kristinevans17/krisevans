   <H1>CHILDHOOD</H1>
<P>I also dreamed of being a doctor when I grow up.I enjoyed spending my time playing with my cousin, i also enjoyed playing patintero, tumbang preso, tagu-taguan and taya tayaan with some kids in street. i oftenly ask my mom for a twenty peso to buy pogs and texts and gamble with some kid in streets. one time, we were playing taya-tayaan outside when a random old women throwed water on us. luckily, we managed to outrun her and made a face on her. but, childhood isn't always fun and rainbows, sometimes... there gotta be fear! 
One morning, when I woke up I heard the shocking news that my friend's gramda died because sge fell into a well.. remember the old woman who throwed pail of water on us? well, she was the one who found the body. 
According to her, she was going to fetch some water, the moment she dropped the bucket, she saw a floating slippers, followed by a feet.. after the burial of my friend's grandma, my mom  didn't allow me anymore to go near their house or near the well because my mom said the ghost of my friend's grandma might pull me in the well and drown me.. well that sucks because I didn't listen to my mom, so one morning, I decided to go to their house and play some dolls when suddenly, the well was caught in fire and the photo of my friend's grandma also sunddenly lit up.
well, i did learned my lesson there, because the moment I came home, I was shaking in fear.
