  <H1>PRESCHOOL</H1>
  <P>my life as a preschool student is fun. I always ace every subject and always on top. I was the best student and got first honor and 6 medals during preschool. my school was near our house. and in kindergarten, I got 1st honor and had to deliver a long speech infront of the stage. I also enjoyed my life as a preschool and kinder student because I was with my cousin, we always bond and play.<P>

   <H1>ELEMENTARY</H1>
<p>elementary days was the days I can say was epic, I got to socialize with other kids and every year, I got honors and medals. I studied in Manila, I can say that the school there in the city was more fun. I got to meet some friends and my parents always buy me jollibee and chowking whenever I got honors. Every year, I receive 500 peso from the barangay because they give money to those kids who gets in honors. one time, my parents bought me two dogs when I got honors, it was a maltese and a labrador.</p>

   <H1>HIGH-SCHOOL</H1> 
<p>two years ago.. I met a guy named Xanredd. He studies at Saint Anthony's college. up until now, were still together to make it short.
I also published a story in wattpad.my high school life is a bit messy aND MISERABLE. Me and my friends experienced bullying. We have no one to talk to nor tell what's happening. we suffered in the hands of our classmates. not until I met someone who made everything feel lighter and eased my worries and sadness away. he wiped the loneliness and despair away and accepted all my flows and imperfection. he was there when no one stayed and he was there on my greatest downfall. Two more years and we'll be able to study in the same school and reach our dreams and goals together. Also,it was quite sad knowing this will be the last year I will be with my friends in the same classroom and next year we'll be reaching our goals and go to our seperate ways. I longed to keep communication with them and be still friends even if we reach the age of sixty.<P>
